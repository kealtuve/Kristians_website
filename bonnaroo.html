							<h2>The Journey to Bonnaroo</h2>
							<span class="byline"></span>
						</header>
                        <p>I will begin the story when I met up with my new friend Erika for the first time. We had just met a couple weeks prior at the Waterfront Music Fest. We had agreed to meet up and go for a ride towards The Falls of Ohio State Park to set up our hammocks and "hang" out. Soon after our conversations started I realized we had a lot in common. One characteristic especially is that we both live for spontaneity. And this is where the idea to road trip to Manchester, Tennessee and sneak into Bonnaroo Music Festival sprouted.  </p>
                        <p>Later that night I suggested for her to watch a documentary i found called ‘No Cameras Allowed’. This is a story of James Marcus Haney who snuck into 50 music festivals! This tale of adventure into the unknown was one of the most inspiring things I have seen. After watching this, our mission to Bonnaroo was a sure thing. We knew we would regret it if we didn’t give it a try.</p>
                        <p>Our plan was to leave Friday after work; which we we both able to get off early.  So here we are, driving down 65 to test the remote possibility of sneaking into this massive music festival. This event covers 700 acres of land! That is huge!</p>
                        <p>After a few stops we finally made it to the site. We drove into the main entrance of the campgrounds and attempted to drive in. This was when the reality of our situation set in. We had in no way prepared for the complexity of this situation. They immediately asked us to step out of the car for the mandatory search and to scan our wristbands. The truth came forth and Erika told the gate attendant we didn’t have wristbands yet. He directed us to the ticket booth, but instead we drove out of the lot. </p>
                        <p>After taking a lap around the festival grounds we decided to go park at a home that was offering daily parking for $5. What a humble price to charge for such a popular event. We drove in and parked her car. We stepped out of Erika’s car and were relieved to get the chance to stretch it out.</p>
                        <p>One big breath in and an exhale… OK now what do we do? We walked down the fenceline of the campgrounds and headed toward the faint sound of the main stage. We found a spot along the fence that could have been a potential place to hop at night time. But it was still bright out so we continued down the road until it arrived at a T-stop and had only two directions to go.</p>
                        <p>There was a dirt path that was only allowed by staff and artists, so really there was only one option left. Trek it through the woods. I had seen an aerial photo and knew that end of this area would reach somewhere near the main stage. But that was just speculation.</p>
                        <p>We battled through thick brush of thorns as we raced the setting sun.  Our only sense of direction was the music that kept getting louder and louder. Finally we saw a break in the treeline up ahead and reached a fence line. Just over the other side was a campsite and there seemed to be no security whatsoever. We hopped over the fence and scurried into the campsite. </p>
                        <p>A brief moment of feeling accomplished, but that didn’t last long because we still had to get into the festival. This had an additional layer of security that is more tightly watched than the campgrounds. Here there is security constantly patrolling the border of the festival grounds. We explore the campgrounds for a moment and then head in the direction of the rest of the people walking. </p>
                        <p>There were golf carts and maintenance vehicles driving through the dirt paths and as we walked along one of the carts slowed down next to us. A guy shouts out asking if Erika was from his class. She looks at him for a moment and then things click. Turns out they are in the same digital art class at the University of Alabama. Turns out the driver's name is Hunter and learned that he is a Manager for the festival. He asked us if we were headed to the stages and that’s when Erika revealed our little secret. She disclosed that we had snuck into the campsite and we have no wristbands to scan in. He stops to think for a moment and then asks us to hop on. </p>
                        <p>We took a quick glance towards each other, then a big grin and we climbed aboard. I was sitting on the hood facing Erika and Hunter so I had no sense of direction of where we were driving. Hunter zipped us through the camp grounds and then past the initial level of security. Now, we were inside the staff area. Bonnaroo employees everywhere, and here comes a speeding golf cart with two festival goers. </p>
                        <p>After a few quick turns we reached the festival gate and he was stopped by a Security staff. The guard began talking to him while we climbed off the vehicle. So while this distraction took place Erika nudged me to go and we slipped passed the guards. We have stepped on festival grounds</p>
                        <p>What a moment of disbelief. We had made it!!</p>
                        <p>I got the chance to look back once I stepped into the crowd. I saw the guard was still talking to Hunter and it didn’t look good. From the looks of his facial expressions we assumed that he was getting in some trouble. Hunter stepped back into the cart and drove towards our direction. Erika and I stepped out onto the road to catch his eye, but he drove past without looking. We felt bad he might have got in trouble because of us, but our worry for him faded as the moment took hold. From this moment forward I was one with the present. Nothing else was on my mind except where I was now.  </p>
                        <p>I was in such a state of awe. Just soaking everything in. I couldn't believe that we had made it inside!</p>
                        <p>We briefly met up with my friend Erik, but that was the only time I would get to see him the rest of the weekend. So Erika and I were on a mission to meet up with her friend Nate. We were able to locate Nate and his friends C and T. That night we had the pleasure of watching Kendrick Lamar, followed by Deadmau5, then ODESZA and STS9.</p>
                        <p>I would consider myself to be a wallflower type of person. I love being a part of social events and gatherings, however there are many times where I will be silent. I become very introverted and observational. I soak in everything that is happening around me. Being this way at a festival isn't a bad thing because there is a lot of observe. A sensory overload. So i just let all my channels open wide and let the journey take me. However, a part of me wished I wasn't this way because this is a rare opportunity to build connections with the people around you. </p>
                        <p>I watched my friend Erika as she floated around the festival grounds and engaged with the people around her. I noticed she has a unique ability to instantly connect with those around her and I admire her for that quality. It is a trait I always wished I had inside me. I am a strong believer that we meet people at the time we need to learn something about ourselves. Erika was just the type of person I needed to show me the world in a new way. </p>
                        <p>Towards the end of the night we realized we will have to sleep on festival grounds because we wouldn't be able to work out the same amount of luck sneaking in again. That night we slept on hay bales that we found by the Solar Stage. During those few hours of shut-eye I had the anticipation that someone was going to wake us up and make us leave, but that never happened. The one time we did get woken up was by friendly event staff walking around doing wellness checks. They made sure we were alive and then left us alone. Here comes the sun bright and early at 5:15am beckoning a new day.</p>
                        <p>We had a lot of time ahead of us until the performances continued at 12:30pm. So we spent the morning wandering the festival grounds and finding some treasures left behind from the previous night. We met some interesting people including Oscar and his horse Bonnie. We also met Joe, an intern for one of the vendors and we learned about his summer traveling to many other festivals. Later that morning we also took part in a yoga session. This time was very peaceful and helped me clear my mind and reconnect with my body. </p>
                        <p>After what felt like an eternity, Nate and his friends met up with us again and the performances began. As we were watching PHOX perform, a band Erika really wanted to see. However, a few songs in and our journey took a sour turn. Erika noticed the car keys were missing. </p>
                        <p>The next couple of hours were spent scavenging the grounds, retracing steps to see if we find something along the way. In addition, we checked all information booths and Erika left her contact information so that she could be notified if they turned up. This was a hard time for me because I felt so helpless. Her moment had been broken and there was nothing in her control. All I could do was remain positive... the keys will turn up. But in a situation like this it's hard to remain positive the entire time. I'll admit I had my own selfish thoughts wondering what I am going to do to make it home. However, we eventually reached a point where all we could do was wait and hope.</p>
                        <p>By this point in time I left the group to make another attempt to meet up with Erik, but I wasn't able to find him. My phone died in the process and the last message I had sent to Erika was to let her know I will be waiting by the Which stage concessions. I waited and waited, no one turned up. Eventually I left to take a lap around the festival grounds to pass by the charging stations but they were full. The line for the battery vendors was too long and I didn't want to pay the $20 for a full charge. Once again I lost control of the situation, but this time I was able to surrender to it. I didn't worry, I just accepted the fact that I might not find any of my friends the rest of the day.</p>
                        <p> I circled back around to the Which stage and made an attempt to go into the crowd and find them. Weaving my way through people, I reached a point where I couldn't continue to move forward. I didn't know whether to stay in the crowd or leave again. I asked people around me when Childish Gambino was playing and they said it wasn't for another couple hours. This was who Erika and her friends were planning on seeing so there was no way they were up here already. At that moment I decided to back out of the crowd and continue my pursuit. As I reached the end of the crowd I saw Erika and Nate waiting for me at the spot I texted earlier. What a relief to see familiar faces! They had good news waiting as well, The keys had turned up! What a great feeling to know that there are good people in this world and did the right thing by turning in the keys to lost and found.</p>
                        <p>So now we had the keys back in our possession and there was not a worry on our minds. We settled in for Childish Gambino and the rest of the night was full of energy with other performances from Bassnectar, Mumford & Sons, and to end the night; Flume. </p>
                        <p>This time after the show, Erika and I joined the mass leaving the festival area. With another bit of luck we passed through the exit gate no problem. We arrived to Nate’s campsite and he was generous enough to offer us his food and shelter. </p>
                        <p>We were up chatting for a bit, but the exhaustion set in and we settled in for the night. Erika and I were up early the following morning and hiked it back to her car. First things first, we changed out of our dirty clothes and into some fresh undies. Keys into the ignition and off we drove as the magic of the moment faded behind. </p>
						<p>So what was the point of me writing all this? Well, last year I began documenting my thoughts so that I could remember ideas. The more I wrote the more form my thoughts took. Eventually I realized that as I reflected on my experiences stories became to form out of them. Looking back at this experience I knew this was one I never want to forget.</p>
                        <h3>Take Aways</h3>
                        <p>Everyone is connected in some way and as we live our lives we leave a ripple effect behind. Some large, some small. I think back to the chance of running into Hunter, and all the tiny things that would have caused us to miss him drive by completely. At first I thought of only myself. I could have tripped somewhere along the hike in the woods and the timing would have been off. But then I think about Erikas life, the same thing could be true. Hell, even Hunter’s life! Everything that has happened in our lives led up to that moment. Because of this realization I believe every human contributed to this experience in one way or another. Not everyone is aware of these ripples, but everyone leaves an imprint behind. </p>
                        <p>Music is a powerful form of expression. The fact that thousands of humans can coexist peacefully and rally behind one cause is a beautiful experience. It is a temporary utopia, and makes me wonder why the rest of the world can’t live together like this? All I know is my way to contribute is by spreading peace back in the real world. And that will take putting myself out there and showing the real me. We all have a light we need to let shine. </p>
                        <p>Life is more fun without plans. Take a journey into the unknown and see what happens. Sure it can be scary at times, but these are the times where you will feel more alive than ever before. You will be tested both mentally and physically, but never give up. Pursue your deepest desires because the more time you let go by the more you will regret. Everything you want lies on the other side of fear. I never would have imagined this journey happening just by meeting someone new.  Now is the time to live, now is the time to take those chances. Don’t wait for these things to happen to you, go out and get it yourself. </p>
                        <p>Open your mind, open your heart and go spread your love to the world. </p>
